The dataset includes a rich set of data on students’ academic performance, their home 
background, and school characteristics.
The dataset contains 29 variables organised in three main groups:
• Academic performance: Students’ performance measured by test scores in three 
subjects, Mathematics, Reading, and Science.
• Home background: Information on students’ home background collected via 
survey.
• School characteristics: Information on students’ school characteristics.
Each observation (row) in the dataset refers to an individual student’s academic 
performance (scores), home background (survey response), and respective school
characteristics.
